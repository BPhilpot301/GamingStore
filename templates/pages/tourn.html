        <h2>Tournaments</h2>
        <p>
            All tournaments will be held every Friday and Saturday starting at 7 p.m. and will end at 12 a.m.
            Although we offer tournaments every Friday and Saturday, not all tournaments are the same.
            Below is a list of the types of tournaments we hold on these days, at the end of
            the list there will be a schedule with the dates and types of tournaments being held.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Tournaments</h3>
        <ol class="info-list numbered">
            <li>
                <strong>League Challenges</strong>
                <p>
                    League Challenges are entry-level, competitive tournaments. League Challenges are a
                    great place to start on your competitive journey. Usually these are held weekly, typically
                    take two days to complete, are played in a Standard format, and are a step up from casual
                    play. This includes multiple rounds with a winner being determined by the final standings.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>League Cup</strong>
                <p>
                    League Cups are events that are a step up from League Challenge tournaments. They
                    feature an increased Championship Points and give competitors more opportunities to test
                    their skills in preparation for larger events. These are often more challenging and involve
                    more competitors.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Regionals</strong>
                <p>
                    Regionals are a major event. These involve a greater number of competitors that are skilled
                    in the game. This is the first step in the official competitive circuit. These events typically
                    draw a large crowd. There is a chance that Regionals will not be at this card shop. The
                    location for every Regionals Competition will be announced within 3 months of the
                    tournament date.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Other competitions include International Championships and World Championships.
            Neither of these competitions will be held at this location, however your competitive
            journey can start here!

    <!-- Contests -->
    <section class="info-block">
        <p>
            Prizes will vary depending on the level of competition you are competing in. Every
            competition will include a well-known prize that will be announced but also include a
            mystery prize that will only be known by the winner after it is received.
        </p>

        <h2>Contests</h2>
        <p>
            Our contests are held once per month. These contests vary; at the beginning of every
            month we will release our contest details, dates, and times.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Contests</h3>
        <ol class="info-list numbered">
            <li>
                <strong>Cosplay contests</strong>
                <p>
                    Cosplay events are divided into multiple categories. They range from Anime, Gaming,
                    Movies, etc. Each contest includes different levels that are set by age and skill.
                    The different levels and requirements can be found at the bottom of this page.

            <li>
                <strong>In-Store pack battles</strong>
                <p>
                    The In-Store pack battles are simple and mainly for fun. Two shoppers can buy up to 10
                    packs of cards and battle each other to see who pulls the better cards. At the end of the
                    pack battle the winner will receive a small prize. If the two shoppers decide to battle for
                    cards, then the winner of the pack battle will not receive a small prize but will win their
                    opponents’ cards instead.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Random Drawings</strong>
                <p>
                    These drawings are exactly how they sound. These are weekly events that are held during
                    tournaments. Each competitor will have their names written down and placed in the
                    drawing pot. Every 30 minutes during the tournament there will be a drawing. Whoever
                    hears their name called wins that drawing. If they are in the middle of a match, their prize
                    will be set to the side to be collected after they are finished competing.
